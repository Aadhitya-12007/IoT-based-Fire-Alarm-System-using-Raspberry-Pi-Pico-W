# IoT-based-Fire-Alarm-System-using-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-W
Combining temperature, gas and smoke sensors with Pico W’s connectivity overcomes limitations of single-sensor alarms.​  End-to-end automation (detection → computation → communication) accelerates emergency response and reduces human error.​  The low-cost, modular design can be adapted for fire monitoring.
